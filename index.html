    <h1>I'm Brian</h1>
    <h2>A Web Developer</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my site. As time goes on and skills develop, there
            will be frequent updates, giving you the best quality I know how. 
            I've spent nearly 25 years learning new skills by working in just 
            about every field I can think of. There was a show from the 90's 
            called <em>The Pretender</em> where a guy raised in a facility uses
            his genius to escape and pretend to be a different professional in 
            a specialized field every episode. That may have sub-conciously 
            influenced me because my resume is a hodge podge of what. For a 
            couple of years now, I've spent a lot of time learning more and more
            programming languages to round my self out. I like solving problems 
            and at its core, isn't that what programming is all about? Be sure to 
            check below for some of my projects, both techy and not techy, as well 
            as my resume. 
        </p>
