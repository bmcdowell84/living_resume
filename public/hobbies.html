    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When it comes to hobbies, and well I guess pretty much anything else, 
        I get a little ADD about it. My interests are all over the place and 
        when something else catches my eye, I'm all about that. Below is a 
        list of some of the things I bounce back to.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Woodwork</b></li>
        <p>I've had a custom furniture and assembly business for several years. 
            Half of my furniture is built by me. I'm not an expert but am self-
            taught and learn something new with everything project. Something 
            enjoyable about creating a piece that's never been seen before.</p>
        <li><b>Movie Props/Replicas</b></li>
        <p>As an avid movie fan, horror in particular, I've spent a lot of time
            trying to create screen accurate replicas. At the time of this creation, 
            I have a horror convention coming to my area and I'm very pumped about it.
            I might try to come up with a couple of items by then to get signed.</p>
        <li><b>DIY</b></li>
        <p>If you ask my wife, I can be extremely difficult. We just bought, what
            I hope is our last house, and there are so many projects to do. Since 
            I'm pretty handy, I tend to do most of it myself. Problem is I'm half
            way finished with about six or seven different things. I'm trying to 
            document the progress to maybe help tick them off one at a time.</p>
        <li><b>Restorations</b></li>
        <p>Me and my wife both love antiques, and something that's alot of fun is
            to try and restore an item to its original glory. A couple of my more 
            recent projects were a gumball machine and a projector. With the later, 
            I was able to replace all of the electrical components, rewire, clean, 
            and change out the bulb. Runs great now.</p>
        <li><b>Video Games</b></li>
        <p>Who doesn't love a good video game? When I have free time, which is rare, 
            I love playing open world adventure games. The only problem is that one 
            of my favorite games had a major update and two others are scheduled for 
            this summer. So...I'm trying to behave and equal out my off time. I do 
            have a lot of outdoor projects that need finishing.</p>
